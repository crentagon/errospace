Mga gusto ko sabihin:
- Penge graphics
- Sorry wala pa masyadong comments
- I haven't connected the existing game to the scenes I've done.

I. MainMenu
- TO ADD:  settings button
II SelectLevel
III. SelectStage
IV. GameScene
- pause enabled
- issue:  should the refresh and pause button disappear when pause button is clicked?
- need:  a file that would store the coordinates of the ball, goal, and planets; separate file per stage
