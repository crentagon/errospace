# Errospace 

Errospace: A simple game where players align planets to guide a rocket to its destination..

## Overview

The title screen.

World selection screen.

Each world has five stages, and offers a new mechanic to the gameplay:

1. **Planets**: movable objects that influence the rocket's gravity.
2. **Black Holes**: immovable objects that influence the rocket's gravity.
3. **Asteroid Belts**: walls the rocket must not crash into.
4. **Warp Drives**: warps the rocket from one place to the other.
5. ???

Sample level. Players need to then drag the planets to where they deem fit, and hit LAUNCH.

...which sends the rocket upward, but thanks to the planets...

...the rocket arrives at its destination! Good job.

Here's another level.

You don't have to collect the three stars along the way, but they serve as a hint on how to complete the level.

...or you could also collect them.

-----------------------

The game is playable, but far from done. It currently only has 9 stages (out of 25), and the sound effects are currently ripped from another game, so it still needs some work. :D
